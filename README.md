# Main Portfolio
## A repository for a coding assignment through MIT | xPro for their <br> Professional Certificate in Coding: Full Stack Development with MERN program.

### Goal:
The goal with this assignment was to create a starter portfolio and publish it through GitHub.

### Execution:
This was fairly straightforward and mainly designed to get used to repositories on GitHub. The portfolio only needed to contain an html file, which utilized some light formatting such as the use of a heading, as well as a reference to an image. The image was also added to the repository. Once completed, the repository was publised to the web and made accessible by a web address.
